# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

For my project I.m going to make a music theory quiz game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My idea for the final project is to make a music theory quiz game. My goal for the final project is to create a game that makes learning music theory fun. 
The game will be built around the circle of filths, the notes that make up chords, and the notes in scales. The program will prompt the user to select a agme mode.
once a game mode is chosen the program will ask the player random questions depending on which game mode the user has chosen.
Then the program will count the number of correct responses and give the user a score at the end of the game.


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

an opperating game that with one game mode based around the circle of filths.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

a game with two game modes based around the cirlce of filths, the notes that make up chords, and a working score board.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

a game with three working gmae modes based on the circle of filths, the notes in a chord, and the notes in scales with a working scoreboard and leader board.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

To successfully make this game I will need to learn how learn how to prompt the user random questions, count the number of correct and incoreect responses.
I will need to learn how to store and display the scores from previous games, and I will need to learn how to make a more user frendly enviornment for the game to be played in.
I will need to research different quiz games to see how they opperate, and to see what I can learn from them. I will also need to research the music theory consepts to make sure that my game is accurate.
